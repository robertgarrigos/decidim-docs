# Install decidim locally on a macosx

Follow instructions to install Rails here: http://installrails.com. This will also install brew.

## Install Passenger:
```
brew install passenger
```

## nginx install:
```
brew install nginx --with-passenger
```
if you already had nginx
```
brew reinstall nginx --with-passenger
```

Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To activate Phusion Passenger, add this to /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf, inside the 'http' context:
```
passenger_root /usr/local/opt/passenger/libexec/src/ruby_supportlib/phusion_passenger/locations.ini;
passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby;
```
So it end up like this:
```
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    passenger_root /usr/local/opt/passenger/libexec/src/ruby_supportlib/phusion_passenger/locations.ini;
    passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby;

    #log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
    #                  '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
    #                  '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
```

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  ```
brew services start nginx
```
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
```
nginx
```

Test nginx is runnig by pointing a browser to http://localhost:8080/

## postgresql install:
```
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

To migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:

To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
```
brew services start postgresql
```

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
```
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
```
