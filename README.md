# decidim-docs
Trying to write some docs to install and deploy decidim for my own reference.

Decidim ([https://github.com/decidim/decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim)) is a participatory democracy framework. It has some docs to install and deploy, but I cannot make it work. Thus, I decided to look around and try to have some docs which actually work. This is, then, mainly a reminder for my self (and for whoever would find it useful).
